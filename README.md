# Titanic Survival Analysis  

This project explores the Titanic dataset using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover survival patterns. Key findings include **higher survival rates for females, first-class passengers, and children**. Passengers who paid **higher fares** and had **certain family members aboard** also had better survival chances. The analysis uses **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib** for visualization.
